## 🧭 Summary

These two weeks is focusing on closing out the prototype implementation and preparing the summary of findings plus recommendations for next steps.

## 🎯 Goals

### [SRL 2 → 3 | Single Service Provider Prototype](https://github.com/input-output-hk/innovation-cavefish/milestone/1)

- Stabilize the renamed commitment proof flow and related stages.
- Finish wiring the WBPS submit function cradle into the prototype.
- Consolidate core/server structure and complete module reorganization.
- Reduce build warnings and keep the codebase clean.
- Validate statement reconstruction and proof checks end-to-end.

## 🛠 Implementation Progress

### Backend & Prototype Logic
- Renamed commitment proof steps (AskCommitmentProof → ProveCommitment) and aligned related types.
- Added proof validation milestones (AssertProofIsValid, Blindly Signed).
- Rebuilt statements from artefacts and updated SessionId handling.
- Extracted event-based concepts and added a submit-function cradle.

### Architecture & Refactors
- Merged core and server projects and moved modules to the updated layout.

### Build & Tooling
- Fixed compile warnings.
