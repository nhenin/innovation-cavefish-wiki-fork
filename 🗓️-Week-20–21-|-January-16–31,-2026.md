## 🧭 Summary

January 16–31, 2026 completed a major finishing pass on the SRL 2 -> 3 prototype:

- protocol sections around verification/signing/submission were completed end-to-end,
- txId-in-circuit work progressed and was integrated into the challenge path,
- emulator submission reached nominal success,
- CI/build hygiene and repository structure were stabilized for closure.

This period effectively moved the stream from "implementation in progress" to "ready for February closure and synthesis".

## 🎯 Goals

### [🎯 SRL 2 -> 3 | Tx-Level Strategy & Single SP Prototype](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cavefish/milestone/1)

- Finalize verification + blind-signing + submission stages.
- Complete txId/challenge alignment and related circuit integration steps.
- Stabilize tests and integration behavior.
- Reduce CI friction and warning noise.
- Prepare artefacts and docs for the stream closing phase.

## 🛠 Implementation Progress

### Protocol flow completion

- Added proof-verification and blind-signing steps in the nominal flow.
- Completed signed transaction submission on emulator in the end-to-end path.
- Continued Intent DSL / satisfy-path integration and related test fixes.

### ZK/circuit and transaction-path alignment

- Integrated txId-related circuit updates and challenge-path adjustments.
- Tuned circuit sizing parameters and message packing assumptions for tx-body handling.
- Added diagnostic logs and technical notes for tx-body CBOR/circuit implications.

### Architecture, CI, and code health

- Consolidated module layout and continued core/server organization cleanup.
- Cached Haskell CI build dependencies and fixed multiple compile/test warnings.
- Performed late-period artifact/setup cleanup after history rewrite.
