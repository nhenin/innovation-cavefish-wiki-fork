## 🧭 Summary

During this period, Cavefish moved from design-complete specs into implementation and delivery planning.
The year-end package plan (prototype, security analysis, Blockfrost roadmap presentation) was set, and the GitHub Kanban workflow was reviewed for public visibility and estimation practices.
Engineering work regrouped SP endpoints, and strengthened logging/config, while WBPS keygen support landed for integration.
Research work scoped the security analysis around the light prototype and continued intent-template exploration.

## 🎯 Goals

### [SRL 2 → 3 | Single Service Provider Prototype](https://github.com/input-output-hk/innovation-cavefish/milestone/1)

- Refine endpoint naming and internal grouping for the Register → Commitment → Submission flow.
- Complete registration integration and start the commitment step implementation.
- Integrate AskCommitmentProof and WBPS registration paths.
- Improve runtime observability and operator configuration.
- Finalize the year-end delivery packages and align stakeholder communications.

## 🛠 Implementation Progress

### Backend & Prototype Logic
- Completed registration integration and aligned terminology with the paper.
- Began the commitment step implementation (Circom snippet translation to Haskell).
- Grouped Register logic and renamed Prepare/Finalise to demonstrateCommitment/askSubmission.
- Merged AskCommitmentProof changes into mainline.
- Added configuration-file support for server settings.

### Research & Security
- Scoped security analysis around the light prototype with a path toward the observer-script strategy.
- Continued work on intent semantics and transaction templates (TX3), plus ideal functionality definitions.

### Observability & Tooling
- Added structured logging to WAI and baseline logging capability.
- Added GHC flags, cleaned Nix shell, and applied formatting/build fixes.

### Frontend & Integration
- Added WBPS key generation support for frontend integration.
