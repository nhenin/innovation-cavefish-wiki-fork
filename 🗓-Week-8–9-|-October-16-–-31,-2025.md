## 🧭 Summary

During these two weeks, the Cavefish initiative moved from architectural alignment to active prototype development.  
The focus was on **refactoring**, **project modularization**, and **integrating the WBPS wrapper** into a functional end-to-end flow.  
The team also began defining the structure of the upcoming **“100-ish Days Demo”**, scheduled for early December, and discussed feasibility spikes to validate **zero-knowledge verification in constrained environments**.

Polina Vinogradova submitted a **Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP)** introducing a new **Intent-Based Transaction Processing model** — a significant step toward aligning ledger behavior with Cavefish’s design goals.  
Meanwhile, the engineering team worked on **sub-project separation**, Nix reproducibility, and CI improvements to prepare for the next milestone.

## 🎯 Goals

#### [SRL 1 → 2 | CPS(s), Specification & Scoped Requirements](https://github.com/input-output-hk/innovation-cavefish/milestone/3)

- **Intent Representation & Ledger Alignment**
  - Submitted the new **Intent-Based Transaction Processing CIP** ([CIP #1110](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1110)) by *Polina Vinogradova*.  
    - Rendered proposal: [CIP — Intent-Based Transactions (Draft)](https://github.com/polinavino/CIPs/blob/polina/light/CIP-%3F%3F%3F%3F/README.md)
  - The proposal introduces a mechanism requiring users to sign both the **transaction ID** and the **hash of guard scripts**, enabling **intent-based validation** and off-chain verifiability.  
  - Continued discussions on the conceptual separation between **intent (observer script)** and **fulfillment (transaction)**, ensuring trust in off-chain resolution logic.

#### [SRL 2 → 3 | Single Service Provider Prototype](https://github.com/input-output-hk/innovation-cavefish/milestone/1)

- **Prototype Development**
  - Progressed on **WBPS wrapper integration** in Haskell and refined circuit flow visualizations via Miro.  
  - Planned a **feasibility spike** to test **on-device verification** using Circom from TypeScript, targeting mobile-friendly execution.  
  - Advanced **Nix shell integration** for reproducible builds and environment portability.  
- **Project Refactoring**
  - Partitioned the main Haskell codebase into **modular sub-projects**, improving build organization and maintainability.  
  - Established a **GitHub Kanban board** and initial issue set aligned with SRL milestones.

#### [SRL 1 | Create Workstream Briefing Pack](https://github.com/input-output-hk/innovation-cavefish/milestone/3)

- Continued production of **non-technical explainers** and **workstream briefs** for community visibility and alignment.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Continuing **WBPS wrapper integration** and end-to-end validation flow.  
- Conduct **feasibility spike** for lightweight (on-device) verification.  
- Prepare **UI prototype** and demonstration scenario for the **100-day demo**.
