## 🧭 Summary
Weeks 3 and 4 focused on producing the first version of the **Cavefish Work Plan (V0.1)**.  
During this period, several adaptations were made — notably a shift from the **BRL + SRL** dual framework toward a more **technology-centric approach**, as the initiative is being driven primarily by the Research team rather than Product.  

The BRL evaluation was therefore dropped, with progress now assessed through the **CIP** and **SRL** frameworks only.  
This change clarified the need for the next iteration to **identify the specific CPSs** relevant to the initiative.

In parallel, the team gathered sufficient information to begin working on the **first technical objective**, the *single-Service-Provider (SP) simple flow*.

## 🎯 Goals

#### Goal 1 — Establish the foundations of the Cavefish initiative and produce a first **V0.1 Work Plan** defining objectives, structure, and validation approach.

- **Defining Objectives & CPS Focus**
  - Shifted focus from product readiness to CPS definition and validation planning.  
  - Introduced structured *Solution Proposal + Validation Plan* (KPIs & acceptance criteria).  
- **Prototyping Strategy**
  - Outlined first prototype flow (zkSNARK intent submission), phased integration to multi-SP testnet demo.  
- **Cryptographic Scope & Delegation**
  - Assigned cryptography (Ezequiel Postan / Jesus Diaz Vico) and server architecture (Will Gould).  
  - Discussed client-side verification and proof generation flows.

#### Goal 2 — [[SRL 2→3 | Single Service Provider Prototype — Initial Zero-Knowledge Circuit Logic and Stack]](https://github.com/input-output-hk/innovation-cavefish/milestone/1)

- **(Started)** Set up the *cavefish-server* project within the repository, focusing mainly on environment initialization and the early exploration of a first architectural model.  
- **(Started)** Refactoring and streamlining the WBPS research prototype, scoping it down to retain only the Cardano-specific components.
