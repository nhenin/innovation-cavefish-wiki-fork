Weeks 5 and 6 continued the consolidation phase initiated with the first Work Plan (V0.1).  

The team refined the project’s positioning as an **intent-based system**, defining its technical boundaries and aligning it with the appropriate **CIP** and **SRL** frameworks.  

With the organizational foundation now in place, focus turned toward the **first implementation objective** — the *single-Service-Provider (SP) flow*.

During this period, the **cavefish-server** project was created to explore early architectural models, and the research prototype (**WBPS**) was refactored to isolate Cardano-specific logic and improve execution and logging, preparing the ground for the first functional demonstrations.


## 🎯 Goals

#### Establish the foundations of the Cavefish initiative and produce a first **V0.1 Work Plan** defining objectives, structure, and validation approach.

- **Intent-Based System Definition**
  - Reframed Cavefish as an *intent-based transaction framework* rather than a pure light client.  

#### [SRL 1 → 2 | CPS(s), Specification & Scoped Requirements](https://github.com/input-output-hk/innovation-cavefish/milestone/3)

- **Mapped CIPs** (Observer Scripts, Nested Transactions, Validation Zones) to define scope.  
- **Clarified value of weakly blind signatures** for trustless LC–SP collaboration.

#### [SRL 2 → 3 | Single Service Provider Prototype](https://github.com/input-output-hk/innovation-cavefish/milestone/1)

- **Set up the cavefish-server project** within the repository, focusing mainly on environment initialization and the early exploration of a first architectural model.  
- **Refactored and streamlined the WBPS research prototype**, scoping it down to retain only the Cardano-specific components.
