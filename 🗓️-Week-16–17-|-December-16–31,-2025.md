## 🧭 Summary

Work focused on completing the DemonstrateCommitment flow section and expanding commitment coverage. WBPS was modularized to support testing, while cooked-validator and cardano-api dependency sourcing were updated alongside Nix cleanup.
Build warnings were addressed across the stack as part of the integration work.
Circuit documentation captured VarLen hashing trade-offs and low-level Blake2b/Sha2 details, highlighting hashing as the primary ZK bottleneck.

While advancing the prototype and refining circuit inputs, we realized the circuit must compute `txId` internally to enable blind signing at the end of the WBPS protocol. This forces use of Cardano's Blake2b, which is poorly optimized for ZK circuits, and performance dropped sharply as we introduced real transaction sizes up to the 16 KiB body limit. We held design sessions to catalog optimization options and documented them for January decisions once most collaborators return from holidays.

## 🎯 Goals

### [SRL 2 → 3 | Single Service Provider Prototype](https://github.com/input-output-hk/innovation-cavefish/milestone/1)

- Complete the DemonstrateCommitment flow section with a nominal-case test.
- Expand commitment specs and test coverage in WBPS.
- Document ZK circuit hashing strategies and design trade-offs to guide optimization.
- Integrate dependency updates (cooked-validator, cardano-api) and keep builds clean.
- Remove stale Nix code and reduce warning noise.

## 🛠 Implementation Progress

### Backend & Prototype Logic
- Completed the DemonstrateCommitment flow section; prepared messages, scalars, and commitments are now wired in.
- Increased WBPS modularization to make testing more targeted.
- Integrated the new cooked-validator version and aligned cardano-api sourcing to support both test and production paths.

### Testing & CI
- Added commitment tests and Commitment.Scalars specs.
- Fixed warnings in WBPS and broader build warnings.

### Build & Tooling
- Removed irrelevant Nix code and merged build-warning fixes.

### ZK Circuits & Research
- Added a WBPS circuit-phase walkthrough and setup trade-off notes in `zk‐SNARK-setups-and-circuit-designs.md`.
- Documented VarLen hashing strategies (O(N^2) black-box vs O(N) conditional state update), with Sha2/Blake2b padding details and VarLen Blake2b pseudocode.
- Flagged hashing as the dominant constraint cost (Blake2b compression ~99% of constraints; 16 KiB implies 128 compression rounds), and noted Halo2 lookup-table optimizations plus Midnight VarLen work as possible relief.
