## 🧭 Summary
During the first two weeks, the **Cavefish** stream was formally launched within the **Light Client Infrastructure** program under *[Cardano Vision 2025 (IC-3)](https://static.iohk.io/ior/IOR_Mid-Year_Fundamental_Research_Report_2025.pdf)*.

The focus was on establishing structure — setting up the repository, defining the Technology Validation approach, and aligning the initiative with Innovation’s governance framework.

Team onboarding and early technical discussions laid the groundwork for translating the research concept into a practical validation plan.

## 🎯 Goals

### Goal 1 — Establish the foundations of the Cavefish initiative and produce a first **V0.1 Work Plan** defining objectives, structure, and validation approach.

- **Initiative Launch & Setup**
  - Cavefish officially initiated as part of the *Light Client Infrastructure* stream under *Cardano Vision 2025 (IC-3 pillar)* with **5 FTEs / 6 months / SRL maturation 1 → 4**.
  - Repository restructured for Technology Validation (**paper + prototype + deliverables**) and CI added ([PR #2]).

- **Alignment & Governance Preparation**
  - Reviewed Technology Validation methodology and SRL criteria.
  - Positioned Cavefish under *Interchains (IC-3)* and prepared Confluence content + [workstream brief].

- **Early Technical Exploration**
  - First weekly meeting introduced the team (*Polina Vinogradova, Will Gould, Jesus Diaz Vico, Pyrros Chaidos, Marc Roeschlin*) and clarified tech-stack choices (**Rust vs Haskell**).

## 📄 Deliverables
- **Work Plan V0.1** draft created and repository initialized for Technology Validation.  
- CI pipeline ([PR #2]) enabled for core components.
